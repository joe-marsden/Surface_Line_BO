# Surface Line Discovery through Bayesian Optimisation

These scripts use a Bayesian Optimisation algorithm to iteratively sample a surface with the aim of converging on two lines that lie within the surface. 

The algorithm used can be found in the following repository:
https://github.com/adamc1994/ALaBO#

## Features

- Gaussian Regression to Initialisation and Iteration Data
- Numerical Solution of Target Lines
- Uncertainty Analysis and Proximity Measurement
- Data Visualisation

## Requirements

- MATLAB 2021a or later
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Installation

- clone repository: https://github.com/joe-marsden/Surface_Line_BO.git
- In MATLAB, navigate to the cloned directory and add to path

## Usage

The main usage file is "SurfaceLineOptimiser.m". The function of other files is as follows:

- "LVBayesianOptimiser.m" contains the algorithm.
- "computedistance.m" is the function for calculating the distance between two lines.
- "sampleSurface.m" samples a surface described by a Gaussian Process model, returning a value.
### Utility Functions
- "computeR.m", "gpPredict.m", "toLatent.m" are to allow the algorithm and GP sampling to run.
